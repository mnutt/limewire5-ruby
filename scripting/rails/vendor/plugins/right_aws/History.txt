  Release Notes:
  
  RightAws includes some new features, including:
  - Support in RightAws::S3 and RightAws::S3Interface for S3 key copy, move, and rename
  - Support for signature version 0 request authentication to EC2, SQS, and SDB
  - Enhanced S3 object meta-header read and update
  - Interoperability with clouds running Eucalyptus (http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu)
    [ Contributed by the Eucalyptus group ]
  - Support for c1.medium and c1.xlarge instance types

  Bug fixes include:
  - Corrected the failure, under certain conditions, of retries of streaming PUTs to S3.
    We now reset the seek pointer of the streaming IO object to its initial position.
  - Removal of an accidental dependency on ActiveSupport in RightAws::S3Interface.get_link().
  - Monkey-patch of the Ruby File class on Windows platforms to correct a problem in lstat.
    The lstat bug was causing failure of very large file uploads on Windows [ Contributed by Benjamin Allfree ] 
  - Fixed parsing of the ETag field for S3 objects
